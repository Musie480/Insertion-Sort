Insertion Sort

This project demonstrates the Insertion Sort algorithm for sorting an array. The Insertion Sort algorithm follows these steps:

1. Iterate through the array, starting from the second element.
2. Compare the current element with the elements before it and insert it at the correct position.
3. Repeat this process until the array is sorted.

Usage:

To use the Insertion Sort algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Create an array of elements.
2. Call the insertionSort method, passing the array and the size of the array.
3. The array will be sorted in ascending order.

Example:

#include <iostream>
#include "sorting.h"

int main() {
    // Create an array
    int arr[] = {5, 2, 7, 1, 3};

    // Call the insertionSort method

    return 0;
}
